# project-12th
My 12th grade project for the CBSE board exams ( made me get a 30/30 in internals so its pretty good. )

Parking has become a task for many with the increase of vehicles on the road, crowds and many more problems. 
We have come up with a program that allows the admin/staff of a parking lot to properly account for each car in the lot for our project for 12th grade cbse.
